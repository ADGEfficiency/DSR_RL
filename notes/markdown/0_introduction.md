### Goals for today and tomorrow

Introduction to **concepts, ideas and terminology** 

Familiarity with important literature

Experience with running reinforcement learning experiments

Guidance on reinforcement learning project ideas

Working with existing code bases

To really learn RL, you will need to dedicate significant amount of time (same as if you want to learn NLP, convolution, GANs etc)
