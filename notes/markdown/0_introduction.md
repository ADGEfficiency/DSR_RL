## Goals for today and tomorrow

Introduction to **concepts, ideas and terminology**.  Familiarity with important literature.  Understanding of the state of the field today.  Practical strageties to run reinforcement learning experiments.

To really learn reinforcement learning, you will need to dedicate significant amount of time (same as if you want to learn NLP, convolution, GANs etc)
