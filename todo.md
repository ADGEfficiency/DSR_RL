Introduce first the bellman equn then the bellman optimality equation (on vs off policy)

---

turn the recaps into a RL quiz!!!!

---

run find_patterns on the notes

## todos on the conversion

examples for everything

rewrite all algorithms into pseudo code

rewrite all the equations into code

for PG section

- TRPO, PPO, DDPG, ACKTR, A3C etc

- MCTS

# Post course

Blog the practical concerns section - include more detail on the methods for individual papers (ie DQN did this, DDQN did this etc)

Incl
- classic control theory

v2 of the course will be
- one day of lectures (split between two days)
- one day of practical (split between two days)

- lightweight slides
- detailed notes

Then I want to do a GANS course!

New practical
- playing a game themselves (ie sending in the action using a debugger or something?)
