Materials for the reinforcement learning course at [Data Science Retreat](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/).

This course is aimed at students with a grasp of supervised learning - no prior understanding of reinforcement learning required.

The course materials are:

- slides for two days of lectures - [pdf](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/blob/master/slides.pdf) - [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/adgefficiency/DSR_RL/master)
- [detailed notes to support lectures and for future study](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/blob/master/notes/)

This repo also has [machine learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/tree/master/literature/general_machine_learning) and [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/tree/master/literature/reinforcement_learning) literature.  Further resources (video lectures, blog posts etc) are listed in [dsr-rl/resources.md](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr-rl/blob/master/readme.md).

This project is built and maintained by Adam Green - [adam.green@adgefficiency.com](adam.green@adgefficiency.com).

### Content

- background statistical concepts
- Markov Decision processes
- value function methods (DQN and it's extensions)
- policy gradient methods
- AlphaGo
- practical advice for experiments
- current state of the art

### Goals for the course

Introduction to **concepts, ideas and terminology**.  Familiarity with important literature.  Understanding of the state of the field today.  Practical strategies to run reinforcement learning experiments.
