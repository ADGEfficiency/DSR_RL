## A glance at reinforcement learning

Materials for the reinforcement learning course at [Data Science Retreat.](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/)  This course is aimed at people with a grasp of supervised learning but no understanding of reinforcement learning.

The course covers Markov Decision processes, value function methods (with a focus on DQN), policy gradient methods,
AlphaGo, practical advice for experiments and takes a look at the current state of the art.

The course materials are
