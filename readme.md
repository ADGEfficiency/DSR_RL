Notes for the rebuild

- don't use the internal section + list all headers in the notes
- no color
- allthe figures will need to be changed (differnt directroy for notes)

should rewrite all algorithms into pseudo code

all of my ML notes should go into here

## section heading

### Section Sub Heading

for PG section
- TRPO, PPO, DDPG, ACKTR, A3C etc

- MCTS 
- alpha beta search - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)

# A glance at reinforcement learning

Materials for the reinforcement learning course at [Data Science Retreat.](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/)

The lecture notes are available as a [pdf](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/blob/master/slides.pdf') and are [hosted
on GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/adgefficiency/DSR_RL/master?grs=github&t=simple#/).

This project is built and maintained by Adam Green - [adam.green@adgefficiency.com](adam.green@aadgefficiency.com).

## Course structure

[Lecture notes](https://gitpitch.com/adgefficiency/DSR_RL/master?grs=github&t=simple#/) are designed to be used as a future reference.

Practical work is using an existing reinforcement learning library to run experiments.

The repo also has an [introducton to tensorflow](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/blob/master/practical/generic_lessons/intro_to_tensorflow.ipynb) and [python tricks](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/blob/master/practical/generic_lessons/python_tricks.ipynb) notebooks.

## Resources 

This repo contains useful [machine
learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/tree/master/literature/general_machine_learning) and [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/tree/master/literature/reinforcement_learning) literature.
