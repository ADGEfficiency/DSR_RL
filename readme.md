## A glance at reinforcement learning

Materials for the reinforcement learning course at [Data Science Retreat.](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/)  This course is aimed at people with a grasp of supervised learning but no understanding of reinforcement learning.

The course covers 

- introduces key statistical concepts
- Markov Decision processes 
- value function methods (with a focus on DQN) 
- policy gradient methods
- AlphaGo 
- practical advice for experiments
- current state of the art

The course materials are

- [lightweight slides used for lectures (in development)](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/blob/master/slides.pdf)
- [medium weight slides for lectures](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/blob/master/old_slides.pdf)
- [detailed notes to support lectures and for future study](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/blob/master/notes/)
