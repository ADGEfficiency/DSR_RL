Materials for the reinforcement learning course at [Data Science Retreat](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/).

This course is aimed at students with a grasp of supervised learning - no prior understanding of reinforcement learning required.  The notes are also deep enough to support those who want to really learn the topic.

This project is built and maintained by Adam Green - [adam.green@adgefficiency.com](adam.green@adgefficiency.com).

### Materials

- [medium weight slides for lectures](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/blob/master/medium_slides.pdf)
- [detailed notes to support lectures and for future study](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/blob/master/notes/)

This repo also has [machine learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/tree/master/literature/general_machine_learning) and [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/tree/master/literature/reinforcement_learning) literature.  Further resources (video lectures, blog posts etc) are listed in [dsr-rl/resources.md](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr-rl/blob/master/readme.md).

### Content

- background statistical concepts
- Markov Decision processes
- value function methods (DQN and it's extensions)
- policy gradient methods
- AlphaGo
- practical advice for experiments
- current state of the art

### Goals for the course

Introduction to **concepts, ideas and terminology**.  Familiarity with important literature.  Understanding of the state of the field today.  Practical strategies to run reinforcement learning experiments.

The course aims to both guide people with no prior knowledge of reinforcement learning and to help those who want to drill deeper.
