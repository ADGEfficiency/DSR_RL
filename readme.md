Materials for the reinforcement learning course at [Data Science Retreat](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/).

This course is aimed at students with a grasp of supervised learning - no prior understanding of reinforcement learning required.  The notes are also deep enough to support those who want to really learn the topic.

### Content

- background statistical concepts
- Markov Decision processes
- value function methods (with a focus on DQN)
- policy gradient methods
- AlphaGo
- practical advice for experiments
- current state of the art

This project is built and maintained by Adam Green - [adam.green@adgefficiency.com](adam.green@aadgefficiency.com).

This repo contains useful [machine learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/tree/master/literature/general_machine_learning) and [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/tree/master/literature/reinforcement_learning) literature.  Further resources (video lectures, blog posts etc) are listed in [dsr-rl/resources.md](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr-rl/blob/master/readme.md).

## Goals for the course

Introduction to **concepts, ideas and terminology**.  Familiarity with important literature.  Understanding of the state of the field today.  Practical strageties to run reinforcement learning experiments.
